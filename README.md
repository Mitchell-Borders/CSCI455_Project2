## Getting Started

This project was created in Visual Studio Code, and must be ran in Visual Studio Code

Instructions on how to both run and use the program can be found in the ProjectDocumentation folder.
There exists both a tutorial video, as well as document.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
  - `ProjectDocumentation`: Contains info in how to run/use the program
  - `Models`: Object models for the project
  - `Utils`: Folder for things that don't have a specific place to be in the program
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
